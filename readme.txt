A Programming Assignment for Data Structures and Algorithms completed
by John Harrington in November, 2020.

This assignment is being shared in order to demonstrate my work to future
employers. I do not authorize nor encourage any academic misconduct that may
result from sharing this content online.

This assignment was designed by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne as part of
their Algorithms Coursera Course partnered with Princeton University.

This program contains three classes: Wordnet, ShortestCommonAncestor, and Outcast.

Wordnet will accept a list of numbered nouns and a separate list describing how
these nouns are related. A directed graph will be created representing these
semantic relationships.

ShortestCommonAncestor will determine the vertex shared by two other vertices,
if any, within the graph that is the shortest common ancestor of two specified
nouns (represented as vertices), and the total distance (number of edges)
between these nouns.

Outcast will accept a list of nouns and determine which noun is the 'outcast,'
that is which noun is least semantically related to the others.
